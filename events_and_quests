# Event & Quest System Notes

This file outlines design concepts for in-game events, daily missions, and AR-based quests.

## Daily & Seasonal Events
- Daily missions: catch specific types, interact with AR creatures, explore areas.
- Seasonal events with limited creatures and unique rewards.
- Global events where all players contribute to unlock rare creatures.
- Event timers and progress trackers for engagement and competition.

## AR Quests
- AR puzzles and mini-games appearing at real-world locations.
- Special quests unlock rare creatures or shiny variants.
- Multiple difficulty tiers to accommodate beginners and experienced players.

## Observations
- Time-limited events encourage daily play.
- AR quests increase real-world exploration and immersion.
- Players respond positively to collaborative global events.

## Future Ideas
- Integrate weather- or region-based event modifiers.
- Introduce story-based quests tied to creature lore.
- Implement multiplayer quests with cooperative challenges.
