# Multiplayer & Trading System Notes

This file contains design concepts for multiplayer interactions, trading, and cooperative gameplay in the AR environment.

## Trading System
- Local Bluetooth or proximity-based trading between players.
- Limited daily trade slots to balance economy.
- Trading rewards or bonuses for completing certain collections.

## Multiplayer Interaction
- AR shared spaces where multiple players see and interact with the same creature.
- Co-op capture events for rare or powerful creatures.
- Friend system with gifting, challenges, and leaderboards.

## Observations
- Shared AR experiences increase social engagement.
- Players enjoy cooperative capture events and friendly competition.
- Proper balancing ensures trading does not break progression.

## Future Ideas
- Implement player arenas for battles and contests.
- Cross-region trading events.
- Introduce guilds or teams for cooperative AR challenges.
