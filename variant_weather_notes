# Creature Variant & Weather System Notes

This file outlines design concepts and early testing notes for shiny-style variants and weather-influenced creature spawns in the environment.

## Shiny Variant System
- Shiny creatures have a very low encounter rate to increase rarity and excitement.
- Visual differences include alternate color palettes and a subtle particle glow.
- Encounter animation should highlight the rarity with a special sparkle effect.
- Players should be able to favorite or “mark” shiny captures distinctly in the journal.
- Consider implementing limited-time shiny events to increase spawn chances.

## Weather-Based Spawn Behavior
- Local weather data is used to influence creature types appearing in the area.
- Rainy weather boosts Water and Electric-type creature spawns.
- Sunny or clear weather boosts Fire and Grass-type spawns.
- Windy weather increases Flying-type encounters.
- Stormy weather introduces rare, high-power variants with boosted stats.

## Observations
- Weather-based spawns feel dynamic and increase exploration.
- Shiny encounter rates need fine-tuning to avoid being too rare or too common.
- Players react positively to visible weather effects on the map.

## Future Ideas
- Add seasonal shiny variants (e.g., special colors during holidays).
- Introduce weather-exclusive evolutions requiring specific conditions.
- Implement a “Forecast Radar” feature so players can plan hunts based on weather shifts.
