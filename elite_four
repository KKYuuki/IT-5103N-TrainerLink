# Elite Four System Notes

This file contains design concepts for AR Elite Four challenges and endgame content.

## Elite Four Features
- High-difficulty AR locations representing Elite Four members.
- Each member specializes in a unique type or theme (e.g., Ice, Psychic, Legendary).
- Players must complete multiple sequential challenges to reach the Champion.
- Rare or shiny creature encounters are more likely during Elite Four attempts.

## Observations
- Provides long-term goals and high-stakes AR exploration.
- Encourages players to master creature collection and AR interaction mechanics.
- Completing the Elite Four unlocks unique badges, items, and lore entries.

## Future Ideas
- Randomized Elite Four member rotations for replayability.
- Introduce “Champion Trials” with community leaderboards.
- Event-exclusive creatures only obtainable through Elite Four challenges.
