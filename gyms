# Gym System Notes

This file outlines design concepts for Gyms and challenges.

## Gym Features
- Gyms are AR locations tied to real-world landmarks.
- Each Gym specializes in a type (Water, Fire, Grass, Electric, etc.).
- Players complete challenges or puzzles to “claim” Gym badges.
- Gyms can have rotating daily or weekly challenges to encourage repeat visits.

## Observations
- Type-specific Gyms create strategy and exploration opportunities.
- AR interactions (scanning, tapping, gestures) make challenges engaging.
- Gym leader aesthetics and animations reinforce creature lore and AR immersion.

## Future Ideas
- Implement cooperative Gym battles with friends to unlock rare creatures.
- Seasonal Gym events with special themed challenges.
- Gym leader customization and progression for repeatable content.
