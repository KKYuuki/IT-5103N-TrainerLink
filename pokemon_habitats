# Creature Habitat & Region Notes

This file contains design concepts for creature habitats, regional variants, and environmental spawns in the AR environment.

## Habitat & Region System
- Different regions (forest, city, beach, mountain, cave) affect spawn pools.
- Certain creatures appear only in specific habitats or during specific weather.
- Time-of-day spawns: night-only, dusk-boosted, morning-active creatures.
- Rare “roaming creatures” migrate between regions, encouraging exploration.
- Regional variants feature slightly different colors, markings, or sizes.

## Observations
- Players enjoy discovering creatures unique to each area.
- Habitat-based spawns increase replay value and exploration motivation.
- Migration patterns add unpredictability and excitement.

## Future Ideas
- Seasonal region changes affecting which creatures appear.
- Mini-habitats inside AR spaces (e.g., ponds, nests, caves).
- Implement rare environmental events triggering unique spawns.
