# Pokédex Lore Notes

This file contains design concepts for Pokémon lore and descriptive entries for the AR Pokédex.

## Pokédex Entries
- Each creature has a unique lore entry, describing habitat, behavior, and history.
- Special notes for shiny or rare variants, highlighting differences in appearance or abilities.
- Entries can include folklore, myths, or local legends tied to the region.
- Observational data can be recorded by players as they encounter creatures in AR.

## Observations
- Rich lore increases immersion and encourages exploration.
- Players enjoy reading about the history and habits of creatures they capture.
- Rare lore entries (mythical or event-exclusive) create collectible incentives.

## Future Ideas
- Include audio narration of lore for AR immersion.
- Add “research notes” feature where players contribute findings to the Pokédex.
- Unlock hidden lore entries via special conditions (weather, habitat, time-of-day).
