# Leveling & Evolution System Notes

This file contains design concepts for creature progression, leveling, and evolution mechanics in the AR environment.

## Leveling System
- XP gained through catching, exploration, battles, and companion walking.
- Creatures have growth stages affecting size, appearance, and abilities.
- Experience multipliers for rare, shiny, or event-exclusive creatures.

## Evolution System
- Branching evolutions based on:
  - Weather conditions  
  - Time of day  
  - Region or habitat  
  - Creature mood or personality  
  - Held items or special triggers
- Special “mythic evolutions” require rare events or multi-step conditions.
- Evolution animations should be visually rewarding and highlight rarity.

## Observations
- Branching evolution increases strategic depth.
- Player engagement improves when evolution requires exploration or special conditions.

## Future Ideas
- Introduce “temporary evolutions” triggered by AR events.
- Cross-region evolution challenges.
- Unlock hidden abilities after completing evolution conditions.
