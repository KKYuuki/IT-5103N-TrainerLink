# Legendary & Mythical Creature Hunts

This file contains design concepts for rare Legendary and Mythical creature encounters and hunts.

## Hunt Features
- Legendary and Mythical creatures appear very rarely and require special conditions to encounter.
- Clues, puzzles, or environmental triggers guide players to their locations.
- Creatures may have unique lore entries describing their history, powers, and regional significance.
- Successful encounters reward special badges, rare items, and Pokédex recognition.

## Observations
- Legendary hunts create excitement and long-term goals.
- Rare encounters motivate exploration and collection.
- Incorporating story elements makes hunts memorable and immersive.

## Future Ideas
- Multi-step hunts involving multiple locations or conditions.
- Mythical creatures that appear only during specific in-game events.
- Legendary duos or trios requiring teamwork or sequential encounters.
- Hidden lore unlocks for completing all Legendary/Mythical captures in a region.
